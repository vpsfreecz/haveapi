HaveAPI Server Project Templates
================================
This repository contains empty project templates for APIs built using the
HaveAPI server framework in Ruby. There are several projects, each different
model backends. You can use these templates when you want to start a new
project.

See `README.md` in project directories to learn more about them.

## Basic
This is an empty project with no model backend.

## ActiveRecord
This project uses ActiveRecord, a well-known ORM from Ruby on Rails, as a model
backend.
